    and land use policy, and an intuitive strategic approach ensures that three6ixty
    clients have the best guidance with their development projects internally, with
    cities and with local communities. \n \nDana has a broad network of relationships
    with city staff and elected officials, and she frequently participates with policy
    working groups and advisory committees. Dana holds an undergraduate degree in
