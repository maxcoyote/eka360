  bio: "Dana is the founder and owner of three6ixty. She envisioned the company as
    a full-service land use and entitlement firm that combined her experience with
    fast-paced project and construction management with her education and knowledge
    of urban planning and regulatory processes. After working as a Director of Development
    at Urban Pacific Builders and Vice President of Development at John Laing Homes,
    Dana started working independently in 2007 and founded three6ixty in 2012.  Danaâ€™s
    25 years of project management experience, extensive knowledge of zoning code
    and land use policy, and an intuitive strategic approach ensures that three6ixty
    clients have the best guidance with their development projects internally, with
    cities and with local communities. \n \nDana has a broad network of relationships
    with city staff and elected officials, and she frequently participates with policy
    working groups and advisory committees. Dana holds an undergraduate degree in
    City and Regional Planning from Cornell University, a Masters of Urban Planning
    from USC and is a licensed member of the American Institute of Certified Planners.
    She serves on the Culver City Planning Commission and as well as on the boards
    of the Jewish Federation and the Hollywood Central Park. Outside the office, Dana
    loves travel, great restaurants, and spending time with her two sons."
