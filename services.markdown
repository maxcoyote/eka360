## A SOLUTION FOR COMPLETE PROJECT SERVICING
We provide service for every aspect of the development process from land acquisition through finished product. We specialize in complex projects including multi-family residential and mixed-use developments, commercial/creative office space, food-service and hospitality projects, and large-scale multi-disciplined ventures.
## CIRCLE THE SQUARE
Stemming from the famous geometry problem of constructing a square whose area is equal to that of a circle, “Square the Circle” is an architectural expression related to solving an “unusually difficult problem”. In the complex, modern day world of land use, our challenge for every client is finding the best possible solutions, even when the regulations make the task seem impossible. Whether your project is one dimensional or multi-disciplined, we have the strategic creativity to ensure a successful Planning effort.
